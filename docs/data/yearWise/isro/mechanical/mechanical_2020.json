    ],
    "answer": "1280",
    "explanation": "For laminar flow in a circular tube, the friction factor (f) is related to the Reynolds number (Re) by the formula f = 64 / Re. Therefore, Re = 64 / f = 64 / 0.05 = 1280."

    "explanation": "Using the energy balance equation (enthalpy in = enthalpy out): (ṁ_cold * c * T_cold) + (ṁ_hot * c * T_hot) = (ṁ_total * c * T_exit). The specific heat 'c' cancels out. (5 * 27) + (15 * 77) = (20 * T_exit). 135 + 1155 = 20 * T_exit. T_exit = 1290 / 20 = 64.5°C."

      "1 m",
      "2.5 m",
      "0.5 m"
    ],
    "answer": "1 m",
    "explanation": "From the first law of thermodynamics, Q = ΔU + W. The work done by the gas is W = Q - ΔU = 2500 J - 1500 J = 1000 J. Assuming the work is done only against the piston's weight, W = m * g * Δx. So, Δx = W / (m * g) = 1000 / (100 * 9.81) ≈ 1.01 m, which is approximately 1 m."

    ],
    "answer": "5000 W",
    "explanation": "First, find the cold space temperature: COP = T_L / (T_H - T_L) => 5 = T_L / (300 - T_L) => 6*T_L = 1500 => T_L = 250 K. Now calculate heat transfer: Q = (k * A * ΔT) / Δx. Using consistent units (cm): Q = (1 W/cm.K * (100*100) cm² * (300-250) K) / 10 cm = 50,000 W. Note: This question was likely deleted by ISRO due to a unit mismatch in the provided options.

      "927 deg C",
      "768 deg C"
    ],
    "answer": "927 deg C",
    "explanation": "For an isentropic compression process, T₂/T₁ = (V₁/V₂)^(γ-1). T₁ = 27°C = 300 K. T₂ = T₁ * (r_c)^(γ-1) = 300 * (16)^(1.5-1) = 300 * 16^0.5 = 300 * 4 = 1200 K. To convert to Celsius, T₂ = 1200 - 273 = 927°C."

      "6 m/s",

    ],
    "answer": "18 m/s",
    "explanation": "The stagnation temperature T₀ is related to static temperature T by T₀ = T + v²/(2*Cp). Here, 36 = 18 + v²/(2*1000). So, v² = 18 * 2000 = 36000. v = √36000 ≈ 189.7 m/s.

    "answer": "280 K",
    "explanation": "Using the formula for heat conduction, Q = (k * A * ΔT) / Δx. 150 = (1 * (3*5) * (T_inner - 2)) / 0.5. 150 * 0.5 = 15 * (T_inner - 2). 75 = 15 * (T_inner - 2). 5 = T_inner - 2. T_inner = 7°C. In Kelvin, T_inner = 7 + 273 = 280 K."

However, the calculation seems based on a different formula, possibly v=rω*sinθ. If x = r(1-cosθ), then 0.8=1(1-cosθ) is not a standard position. The provided solution uses a direct formula relating displacement from an end, not center. A simpler way: max velocity at center is v_max = rω = 4π. The answer suggests sinθ=3/5, so v = rω*sinθ = 1 * 4π * (3/5) = 2.4π m/s."

      "31.62",

    ],
    "answer": "10",
    "explanation": "The torsion formula is T/J = τ/r. For a solid shaft, J = (πd⁴)/32 and r=d/2. This simplifies to τ = 16T / (πd³). Rearranging for d: d³ = 16T / (πτ) = (16 * 55000 Nmm) / ((22/7) * 280 N/mm²) = 880000 / 880 = 1000 mm³. So, d = 10 mm."

    "answer": "2S(c/r)^(1/2)",
    "explanation": "The Griffith crack theory for brittle materials relates the applied stress (S) to the concentrated stress (Sc) at the tip of an elliptical crack by the formula Sc = 2S * √(c/r), where 'c' is half the crack length and 'r' is the radius of curvature at the crack tip."

    "answer": "12/7",
    "explanation": "Mean stress σ_m = (200+100)/2 = 150 MPa. Variable stress σ_v = (200-100)/2 = 50 MPa. Using the Soderberg failure criterion: (σ_m / σ_y) + (σ_v / σ_e) = 1/N. (150 / 450) + (50 / 200) = 1/N. (1/3) + (1/4) = 1/N. (7/12) = 1/N. Therefore, the factor of safety N = 12/7."

    "explanation": "The natural frequency (f_n) is related to static deflection (Δ) by f_n = (1/(2π)) * √(g/Δ). Rearranging for Δ: Δ = g / (2π * f_n)². Δ = 9.81 / (2π * 1.6)² ≈ 9.81 / 100.53 ≈ 0.097 m, which is 97.06 mm. The closest answer is 98.1 mm."

    "explanation": "The modified Gibbs Phase Rule when pressure is constant is P + F = C + 1. Here, P (phases) = 1, C (components) = 2. So, 1 + F = 2 + 1, which gives F (degrees of freedom) = 2."

The base acceleration amplitude a_max = Yω², so Y = 3/10² = 0.03m. r = 10/20 = 0.5. With negligible damping (ζ=0), A = Y * r² / (1-r²) = 0.03 * (0.5)² / (1 - 0.5²) = 0.03 * 0.25 / 0.75 = 0.01 m, which is 10.0 mm."
