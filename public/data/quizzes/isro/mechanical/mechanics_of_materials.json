            "answer": "5.0 kNm",
            "explanation": "The maximum equivalent torque (Te) on a shaft subjected to both bending moment (M) and twisting moment (T) is calculated using the formula: Te = sqrt(M^2 + T^2). Here, Te = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.0 kNm."

            "explanation": "First, calculate the reactions. R_right = (12 * 1) / 3 = 4 kN. R_left = 12 - 4 = 8 kN. The maximum bending moment occurs at the point of the load application. M_max = R_left * 1m = 8 kN * 1m = 8 kNm."
